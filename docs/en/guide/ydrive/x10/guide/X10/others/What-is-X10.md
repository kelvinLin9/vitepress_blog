> ## AI Revolution: Key to Achieving Ten-Times Productivity Improvement
>
> By employing AI techniques, enterprises can successfully increase productivity for several reasons:

#### 1. Data Processing Optimization

Using AI analysis tools to accurately predict production bottlenecks and swiftly adjust to enhance efficiency.

#### 2. Intelligent Robots and Automated Equipment

Introducing robots capable of autonomous task execution and unmanned supervised operation equipment to enhance production line speed and consistency.

#### 3. Optimization of Supply Chain Management

Utilizing AI to forecast market demand and optimize inventory management. This enhances delivery speed, reduces costs, and strengthens competitiveness.

### Simplifying Tasks

Performing simple tasks without using professional software is preferred. Learning and creating with professional software takes more time and complicates collaboration. For instance, creating files using Adobe software can be challenging because others might not be able to open them, and providing support becomes difficult. Collaboration is crucial, and it becomes ten times harder without accessible tools.

### Utilizing AI Agents

Using Agents for production is the solution. Agents are AI robots, and they are not just one robot; they are a group of robots that cooperate with each other. With the help of Agents, we can automate processes and accomplish tasks that used to require a significant amount of time in a simpler way. This method involves natural language, allowing everyone to communicate with Agents using human language to achieve their goals.

### The X10 Spatial Concept

The X10 spatial concept is crucial, where X10 space is open-ended, devoid of the concept of 'people' but focused on 'services'. Users issue simple commands, and AI automatically executes them, returning the results. Data retrieval no longer relies on traditional API calls but rather operates akin to broadcasting, making it more convenient, rapid, and intuitively simple for users.
